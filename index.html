                    <h3>Arallon<span>, Peter’s Passion Project</span></h3>
                    <p>Peter believed that the future of our species lay where all species once began: the ocean. Until his passing, Peter worked tirelessly pioneering Arallon, an experimental community that would help humanity develop its full potential.</p>
                    <p>He strongly believed there were new ways to govern, and that there could be positive, drastic changes in the way we live, work, and play. With all land on earth claimed, Peter maintained change would have to take place on, and sometimes beneath, the surface of our planet’s oceans. (The meaning of the latter remains unclear.) Thus, Peter engaged top engineers and architects, and began by converting a disused oil rig in the middle of the Pacific as the foundation for the vibrant future community he envisioned. Sadly, he did not live to see his dream become a reality.</p>
